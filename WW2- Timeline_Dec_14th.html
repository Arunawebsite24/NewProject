                    <b><u>The Mukden Incident</u></b><br>
                    <p class="MsoNormal">The Mukden Incident was an explosion on 
					September 18, 1931, when Japanese troops occupied the city 
					of Mukden (now Shenyang, China), beginning Japan's invasion 
					of Manchuria. It was probably staged by the Japanese 
					Kwantung Army, independent of the government, to provide a 
					pretext for occupation. Japan saw Manchuria as essential to 
					the security of its colony in Korea and took the step with 
					apprehension about the unification of China under Chiang 
					Kai-shek and Soviet influence in the area.<o:p></o:p></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">A small explosion of the Japanese-owned 
					South Manchurian Railway, blamed on Chinese forces, provided 
					the pretext. Although damage was limited, Japanese troops 
					attacked the nearby Chinese garrison with artillery. 
					Offering little resistance because of Chiang Kai-shek's 
					policy of nonresistance, Japan was able to occupy all of 
					Manchuria within three months.<o:p></o:p></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">The League of Nations, through the 
					Lytton Commission, condemned Japan as the aggressor. In 
					response, Japan withdrew from the League and established the 
					puppet state of Manchukuo, which was not recognized by any 
					country. The Japanese government, unable to control the 
					Kwantung Army, saw its Prime Minister resign in December. 
					The subsequent government, swayed by public opinion, 
					endorsed the invasion, cementing Japan's control over 
					Manchuria until 1945.<o:p></o:p></p>

                    <p class="MsoNormal">On January 30, 1933, Adolf Hitler was 
					appointed Chancellor of Germany by President Paul von 
					Hindenburg. The wide discontent with the economic 
					instability of Germany and the Treaty of Versailles drove 
					his rise to power. In the elections of July 1932, the Nazi 
					Party became the largest in the Reichstag, winning 230 
					seats. However, initially, Hindenburg was unwilling to 
					appoint Hitler because of his radicalism and the violence of 
					the SA (Brownshirts).<o:p></o:p></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">After the chancellorship of General 
					Kurt von Schleicher, conservative elites led by Franz von 
					Papen persuaded Hindenburg to appoint Hitler, assuming they 
					could still control him as long as the influence of Nazis in 
					the cabinet was reduced.<o:p></o:p></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">Hitler consolidated power immediately 
					upon entering office and established a police state with the 
					Gestapo. He also killed all opposition and began Nazi 
					totalitarian rule, laying the foundation for World War II.<o:p></o:p></p>

                    <b><u>Annexation of Austria</u></b><br>
                    <p class="MsoNormal">In 1938, Austria and Germany were 
					united politically under the annexation by Adolf Hitler, 
					known as the Anschluss. The unification of both countries 
					had been a notion since 1919, but after Hitler came to 
					power, the idea became less attractive. A Nazi coup in 1934 
					failed, leaving Austria in the hands of a right-wing 
					authoritarian regime, which later put up little resistance 
					to Hitler's actions.<o:p></o:p></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">In February 1938, Hitler forced 
					Austrian Chancellor Kurt von Schuschnigg to turn power over 
					to Austrian Nazis. Schuschnigg called a plebiscite on the 
					Anschluss but, under Hitler's pressure, canceled it and 
					resigned, ordering the Austrian Army not to resist. German 
					troops entered Austria on March 12, 1938, and the next day, 
					Hitler annexed the country. A controlled plebiscite was held 
					on April 10, in which an overwhelming approval for Austria 
					joining Nazi Germany was registered.<o:p></o:p></p>

                    <b><u>Start of World War II</u></b><br>
                    <p class="MsoNormal">Beginning on September 1, 1939, the 
					invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany initiated World War II. 
					Until its conclusion on October 5, 1939, the campaign was 
					marked with the strategies of "blitzkrieg," as German forces 
					moved quickly from multiple points of attack. The army of 
					Poland, at a strategic disadvantage in both manpower and 
					geography, was readily overcome. In the first days of 
					combat, the Luftwaffe decimated the Polish air force, paving 
					the way for rapid and mobile panzer divisions to subdue 
					ground forces.<br><br>Although both Britain and France 
					declared war on Germany on September 3, neither took any 
					effective action. A Polish counterattack in the Battle of 
					Bzura (September 9-15) enjoyed brief success but could not 
					stem the tide. On September 17, the Soviet Union invaded 
					Poland from the east, as provided for under the Nazi-Soviet 
					Pact, and Poland was defeated. Warsaw fell on September 27, 
					and the country was divided between Germany and the Soviet 
					Union.<br><br>The losses were as follows: 14,000 Germans 
					dead or missing, 30,000 wounded, while Polish losses were 
					about 66,000 dead, 130,000 wounded, and 400,000 captured. 
					Despite this crushing defeat, Polish resistance led to the 
					establishment of a strong underground movement and a Polish 
					army in exile, which made vital contributions to the Allied 
					war effort in key battles.<o:p></o:p></p>

                    <b><u>Attack on Pearl Harbor</u></b><br>
                    <p class="MsoNormal">The attack on Pearl Harbor on December 
					7, 1941, was a surprise Japanese assault on the U.S. naval 
					base in Hawaii, prompting the U.S. to enter World War II. 
					Tensions had escalated due to Japan’s expansion in Asia and 
					U.S. embargoes on vital resources like oil.<o:p></o:p></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">Planned by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, 
					the attack began on the morning of December 7, with nearly 
					200 aircraft launched in two waves. The first wave destroyed 
					over 180 U.S. aircraft and heavily damaged battleships, 
					including the USS Arizona and USS Oklahoma. The second wave 
					caused additional damage before the Japanese forces withdrew 
					by 9:00 am.<o:p></o:p></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">The attack resulted in over 3,400 
					American casualties, including more than 2,300 deaths. 
					However, U.S. aircraft carriers were not in port and 
					remained intact, later proving critical in the war. The 
					attack marked a turning point, leading to the U.S. declaring 
					war on Japan.<o:p></o:p></p>

                    <p class="MsoNormal">In May 1940, there were 800,000 French 
					troops positioned behind the Maginot Line, while other 
					positions, considered weaker-like the Ardennes Forest-were 
					merely lightly guarded. Germany launched a diversionary 
					attack against the Maginot Line while their main assault 
					came through the allegedly tank-impassable Ardennes.<o:p></o:p></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">On May 10, the German army invaded the 
					Netherlands and Belgium; by May 12, a second powerful force 
					had broken through at Sedan and reached open ground by May 
					15, then to the coast by May 20, cutting the Allies from 
					behind and threatening their key ports such as Dunkirk.<o:p></o:p></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">The lightning advance of Germany, made 
					possible by better tactics and coordination of armored 
					divisions along with air power, had the Allies in disarray. 
					By May 22, the British Expeditionary Force was threatened 
					with encirclement, which made the French consider evacuation 
					and retreat.<o:p></o:p></p>

                    <p class="MsoNormal">V-E Day, May 8, 1945, was the official 
					end of World War II in Europe. On that day, German armed 
					forces formally and unconditionally surrendered to the 
					Allies. Conceding to the Allies on this day, German troops 
					surrendered their arms in cities from Prague to Copenhagen 
					and Berlin, where the final battles were crucial, with 
					significant fighting by the Soviet Union. Fighting in Prague 
					was extremely costly, and upwards of 1 million German 
					soldiers retreated west to avoid being captured by the 
					Soviets; the Soviets took approximately 2 million German 
					prisoners.<o:p></o:p></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">Although the formal surrender was 
					recognized on May 8, fighting continued in some areas. In 
					Moscow, May 9 became the official V-E Day, with Joseph

					<p class="MsoNormal">On September 2, 1945, Japan formally

					<p class="MsoNormal">After successfully testing the atomic 
					bomb, the U.S. issued the Potsdam Declaration demanding 
					Japan’s unconditional surrender, which Japan initially 
					rejected. On August 6 and 9, atomic bombs were dropped on 
					Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the Soviet Union declared war on 
					Japan, attacking Manchuria. Facing these events, Emperor 
					Hirohito agreed to surrender, provided his sovereignty was 
					preserved. Following clarification from the Allies, Japan 
					announced its surrender on August 15, with the formal 
					ceremony held on September 2.<o:p></o:p></p>
